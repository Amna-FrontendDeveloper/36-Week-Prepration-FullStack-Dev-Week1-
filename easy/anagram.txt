üß† What this function does
It checks whether two words or phrases are anagrams of each other.

‚ùì What‚Äôs an anagram?
An anagram is a word or phrase that is made by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

For example:

"listen" and "silent" are anagrams ‚úÖ

"hello" and "world" are not ‚ùå

üß© The Function Explained
___________________________________
function isAnagram(str1, str2) {
This line defines a function called isAnagram that takes two inputs: str1 and str2 (the two words or phrases you want to compare).

const sortedStr1 = str1.toLowerCase().split('').sort().join('');
  const sortedStr2 = str2.toLowerCase().split('').sort().join('');

Let‚Äôs break this part down using an example:

Let‚Äôs say:

str1 = "Listen"
str2 = "Silent"
.........Step-by-step:
1 .toLowerCase()
Changes "Listen" to "listen" (so that it's not case-sensitive).

2  .split('')
Turns "listen" into an array of letters:
['l', 'i', 's', 't', 'e', 'n']

3  .sort()
Sorts the letters alphabetically:
['e', 'i', 'l', 'n', 's', 't']

4 .join('')
Joins the letters back into a string:
"eilnst"

Now both words become "eilnst" if they are anagrams.

  return sortedStr1 === sortedStr2;

This compares the two sorted strings:

If they are the same, it returns true ‚úÖ (they are anagrams).

If they are different, it returns false ‚ùå (they are not anagrams).

isAnagram("Listen", "Silent"); // true
isAnagram("Hello", "World");   // false

üí¨ Final Summary:

This function checks if two words contain the same letters, just in a different order.
 It ignores uppercase and lowercase differences.
 If they match after sorting, they are anagrams.

The time complexity of the isAnagram function is O(n log n) because of the sort() method used to sort the characters in the strings.

Why O(n log n)?
1. Sorting Algorithm: The sort() method in JavaScript typically uses a sorting algorithm like QuickSort or MergeSort, which have an average time complexity of O(n log n).
2. String Length: The number of operations performed by the sorting algorithm depends on the length of the string (n). As the string length increases, the number of operations grows logarithmically.
3. n log n Complexity: The product of the string length (n) and the logarithmic factor (log n) results in a time complexity of O(n log n).

Impact on Performance
- For short strings, the O(n log n) complexity may not be noticeable.
- For longer strings, the sorting operation can become a performance bottleneck.

Alternative Approaches
- Using a hash table or frequency counter can reduce the time complexity to O(n), making it more efficient for¬†large¬†strings.
